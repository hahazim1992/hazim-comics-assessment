-search box catered for date_last_updated, name, real name and id but id is not shown on home page
-search box has auto fill but must choose with arrow key and click the enter key from the suggested list
-search box handles fuzzy search and the dataview will display result dynamically as you type
-clicking read more button at the respective character card will bring the user to the character page where id is used to fetch the character profile
-user can click at the home icon located on the far top left to return to home page

-unable to complete lazy load on time
-unable to start unit test
-unable to start CI/CD
